## üîç Project Overview

**Precision Control** is a lightweight, performance-oriented C# application built to interact with embedded hardware systems under strict resource constraints. This project demonstrates the viability of C# traditionally used in enterprise applications for real-time control tasks when designed with disciplined optimization.

The system interfaces directly with GPIOs, sensors, and actuators using platform-specific drivers and low-level APIs, enabling deterministic execution for time-sensitive operations. As part of a **system integrations study**, this project explores the bridge between managed .NET code and bare-metal hardware capabilities.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design

The software architecture prioritizes **determinism** and **separation of concerns**.

```text
+--------------------+ +------------------+ +-------------------+
| Application UI | --> | Control Core | --> | Hardware Drivers |
| (CLI / API Layer) | | (State & Timing) | | (SPI, I2C, GPIO) |
+--------------------+ +------------------+ +-------------------+
|
+---------------------------+
| Optimized Algorithms & RT |
+---------------------------+
```
Generated code
*   **Control Core:** Central logic for timing, control loops, and command sequencing. Critical loops run on dedicated threads with elevated priority.
*   **Hardware Drivers:** Provides a consistent interface for direct hardware communication (e.g., `libgpiod`, `DeviceIoControl`). New devices can be added by implementing a common interface.
*   **Optimizations:** Critical paths employ techniques like object pooling, `Span<T>`, and lock-free data structures to minimize jitter and garbage collection pauses.

## üîå Hardware Interface

The application is designed to be adaptable and currently supports:
- **Platforms**: Raspberry Pi 4/5 (Linux), BeagleBone, Windows IoT Core devices.
- **Protocols**: I¬≤C (for sensors like BME280), SPI (for high-speed ADCs), UART, and GPIO.

üìå *See `/docs/hardware-setup.md` for wiring diagrams and pin configurations.*

## ‚öôÔ∏è Optimization Techniques

To meet real-time expectations, the following strategies were applied and validated using tools like `BenchmarkDotNet`.

| Technique | Purpose |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Object Pooling** | Reuses objects to avoid GC pressure in tight loops. |
| **`Span<T>` & `Memory<T>`** | Enables zero-allocation data manipulation. |
| **No LINQ/Runtime Reflection** | Reduces jitter and unpredictable overhead. |
| **Fixed-Size Buffers** | Ensures predictable memory layout and access times. |
| **Thread Prioritization & Affinity** | Guarantees timely execution on the target CPU core. |
| **Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation** | Achieves faster startup and lower jitter using Native AOT. |

üìä **Performance Metrics (Raspberry Pi 4, .NET 8):**
- **Avg. Loop Latency:** ‚â§ 1.2 ms
- **Max GC Pause:** < 3 ms
- **CPU Usage:** < 35% at 1kHz control rate
- **RAM Usage:** ~42 MB steady-state

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8 SDK or later.
- A target embedded device (e.g., Raspberry Pi with Raspbian OS).
- SSH & SCP access for remote deployment.

### Installation & Deployment

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/precision-control.git
    cd precision-control
    ```
    <!-- Don't forget to change 'your-username' to your actual GitHub username! -->

2.  **Restore Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```

3.  **Build and Publish for Target:**
    ```bash
    # Example for a 64-bit ARM Linux target like Raspberry Pi
    dotnet publish -c Release -r linux-arm64 --self-contained true
    ```

4.  **Deploy to Device:**
    ```bash
    # Securely copy the published files to the target device
    scp -r ./bin/Release/net8.0/linux-arm64/publish/* pi@<DEVICE_IP>:/home/pi/precision-control/
    ```

5.  **Run on Device:**
    ```bash
    # SSH into the device and run the application
    ssh pi@<DEVICE_IP>
    cd /home/pi/precision-control/
    sudo ./PrecisionControl
    ```
    *üîê `sudo` may be required for direct hardware access.*

## üß† Best Practices & Lessons Learned

C# is viable for embedded systems, but only with intentional, performance-aware design.

Avoid dynamic allocations in timing-critical paths to prevent unpredictable GC pauses.

Real-time is not guaranteed in a managed environment; design with defensive checks like watchdogs and timeouts.

Profile everything. Don't assume where bottlenecks are. Test under real load, not just on a development machine.

Design for graceful degradation. Your software should handle hardware failures without crashing the entire system.

This project was instrumental in deepening my understanding of system integration, cross-layer debugging, and performance tuning key skills in modern industrial software.
